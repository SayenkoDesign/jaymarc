Quesitons:

- What does a video testimonial look like? https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/console/22034898/467373902/comments/148975103

- Is this a slideshow, or just arrows to tell someone they should click? Then it opens a popup https://www.evernote.com/l/AOGJSyo1jcFDopIxasWZIqrIVpQINLzlP-A 


- Private appointments schedule here https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/#/console/22034898/467375139/preview where does this go?

- Which Individual BIO page do I use? There are two versions.

- https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/console/22034898/467690483/preview what do the buttons do for "Available, and Custom homes". Are those suppposed to be tabs, or are we going to have two different pages? I'd prefer two different pages.

Need to understand how these are connected.

- Available homes - pulls data from floor plans
- Floor Plans - where all the data is stored https://www.jaymarchomes.com/plan/florence-avante

- Portfolio items are completely seperate.
